# Firebase Management

Tool to handle data with a firebase project and between projects using Flutter and Dart

## Getting Started

There is are two main ways to use this application

1. Use the online version for something quick with optional persistence [here](https://fir-management-c07b8.web.app/#/)
2. Clone or fork to use offline and expand off of for personal customization.
    1. There is also the option of using this on your phone since it is a flutter project, 
    but I don't plan to maintain that 

## Contributing Guidelines 

nothing formally created. If you see this it's hopefully early in the project, and I haven't made time to write it down.

To have changes approved
1. create a ticket and with the feature or enhancement tag
2. included your intended requirements and functionality 
3. branch off of <ins>_master_</ins> and commit changes there
4. submit a pull request into master and hopefully a testing kit will be ready
